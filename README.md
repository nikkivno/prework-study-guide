# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description
The motivation of this webpage is to hold a central knowledge base for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Github facts to assist new coders. This webpage was created to catalogue newly learned skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and transferring code to Github. The goal of this webpage is to allow the user to have a reference point that can be updated as new knowledge in learned. Through the workthrough of this project I have learned the basics of connecting all of these elements (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git) to create a functional webpage.
